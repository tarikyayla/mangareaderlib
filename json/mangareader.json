Back then, she was a quiet girl who had a quirky oddness to her. When he runs into her out of coincidence two years later, however, he finds that she's become an out-going (if not slightly high-strung) girl. A few weeks after their chance meeting, he receives a phone call from the hospital saying she had tried to kill herself, and he finds out the true reason for the drastic change.\r\n\r\n• Fight!\r\nYuki's a hard-working 21 year old who's tirelessly slugging away as a coordinator at a English language school so that she can save enough money to go study abroad.

Countless lives and property were lost or irreversibly affected in what would be known as the greatest disaster in the city’s history.\r\nIn time, the lowest layer, known as the “Prison”, became the home to people who lost much of their former lives during the “Gran Forte”. Crime, famine, and disease run rampant, with “The Noncorroding Gold Chains”, the ruling organization in the area specializing in the sex trade, keeping what little order that still exists. Meanwhile, a contagious disease which causes the infected to grow wings has spread throughout the city, and a unit commonly known as the “Wing Hunters” has been formed to deal with these people swiftly and often violently.\r\nIn this “Prison” resides Caim Astraea, a freelance ex-assassin who does odd jobs for his friend, the head of “The Noncorroding Gold Chains”, for money. During one request, Caim finds Eustia, a winged girl who emits the pale purple light characteristic of the “Gran Forte” incident years ago. His encounter with Eustia will take him on a journey which will involve him with the most influential bodies of the city, including the Church and the royal government.

The problem with straight to tankobon manga is that there is no indication whatsoever of when the next volume might be released.\r\nThough the author is the same, the artist has changed from the original manga. The realistic grit of Masayuki Taguchi has been replaced by the lighthearted cartooniness of Hitoshi Tomizawa. Also, though it is still written by Koushun Takami, the original story is based on the universe of the films rather than that of the original novel. ",

Her nickname \"Maruko\" is made of marui (\"round\", because of her round face) and -ko (girl child); the prefix chibi and the suffix -chan also refer to a cute child.\r\n\r\nMaruko's trademark face fault in reaction to embarrassment is the sudden appearance of vertical lines on her face, sometimes with an unexplained gust of wind blowing behind her head. This is sometimes mimicked by female fans of the series who draw the fingers of one hand down across the face to show embarrassment. On the internet this is often used as emoticons, by speech marks. For example: -_-\"\r\n\r\nOther characters include Maruko's classmate and best friend Tama-chan. A fan favorite is Maruko's kind but absent-minded grandfather. Naive and easily tricked, he keeps a pet turtle and loves watching TV with Maruko.

However, unlike most textbooks and historical mangas, Date Bashira does not focus on the Shogun or famous figures in history. Instead, it brings to light the untold stories of the things surrounding these famous figures. For example, one story tells about the role of how beautiful young men were always accompanying the shoguns into battle. As women were not allowed into a battle zone, the warlords would use these teenage boys to satisfy their sexual urges.\r\n\r\nA different chapter tells the history of the wives of the Shoguns and focuses on the female role in the Sengoku era. As young women were forced into arranged marriages, usually as peace offerings or spies, their husbands usually die in battle at a very early age, as it was the era of war. Date Bashira discusses the idea of remarriage for these women and if they were really in love or were playing the role of a wife.\r\n\r\nDate Bashira takes a different perspective at one of Japan’s most talked about era and even though it is informative, you never get the feeling of a lecture. The beautiful artwork, splash of comedy and the untold, yet interesting historical information really keeps the reader glued onto the pages. [vyc, mangahelpers]",

Sword goes to attack Ios, but quickly realizes that the body is far weaker than his demon form, especially from being recently beaten to hell.\r\n\r\nSince the brothers had been found heavily thrashed, their memory loss isn't that surprising. Their large change in behaviors is also explained by amnesia. As it turns out, Sword entered the body of the cliché nerd who can't run fifty meters without falling.

While the angel and devil have primary control over the bodies of the twins, reflex actions and memories of the other souls (still alive within the bodies) do appear. More importantly, the human bodies cannot handle the powers that Sword and Ios had used with ease.

He was recruited into his current high school as the new soccer coach, and his observation skills and ability to predict the opponents’ movement make his sole presence enough to win games.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Hiromasa is going to be coaching at the high school has many top soccer players flocking to this school, but none stand out more to him than Sakamichi Kappo. Not only can Kappo score a goal from half field with his powerful kick, but his ball control is second to none. Initially, Kappo didn’t want to play on a team because he thought no one understood “his soccer style,” but when Hiromasa was able to understand it, Kappo decideds to play for the team. Will the brilliant coach and the talented player be able to take the high school soccer world by storm? ",

The power of these arms vary, but they can stop normal bullets and deflect some others. The number of them differ with each diclinous, as does their full range.\r\n\r\nThe tendency for violence among diclonii is high, especially as they grow older. As children, their violence stems from a certain playfullness, unlike the absolute hatred of humans in their later years. Diclonii are rare, as they are the members of their species that are able to reproduce naturally.\r\n\r\nSilpelits are more common. They are the offspring of two humans, the male of which has been infected with the mutation. Interestingly, only males can pass on the genes, and all diclonii and silpelits turn out to be female. Certain scientists noticed an increasing number of babies with horns being born, along with those children murdering their own parents and others, and tried to contain the spreading and find out the cause by placing them in a Facility in cells where they are subject to inhumane experiments to test their abilities or were they await execution for being too dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe main non-mutant character in the story is Kouta, who ends up becoming increasingly involved with one diclonius in particular, the main mutant character Lucy, the only pure diclonius, as she seeks a way to infect or kill all of humanity. Lucy has a cruel and unsettling past, and she has long since lost her empathy for humans, except for Kouta.\r\n\r\nHowever, Director Kakuzawa, who has diclonius ancestry although he doesn't have the vectors, has plans to mate with Lucy and start a true diclonius race. If Lucy is found and he manges to do so, humanity will be nonexistent.\r\n\r\nKouta and Lucy's lives have been intertwined since their childhood, but not necessarily in a good way. And after the virus is airborne and spread across all of Japan, what is the fate of humanity and who holds all of the answers? (Written by MAL member: luvsanime02)",

Tomu Shirasagi, a gambler, is a mysterious new transfer student who has come from a public school (instead of a prestigious private one) and faces the elitist environment. There, he declares a challenge toward any student and claims he will bring to the ruin the whole school through a series of gambling matches. Nobody knows why he has come to that school or what the real motivations behind his actions are.\r\nDuring any match, Tomu shows off all of his unique coolness and ability.\r\nHe employs a wide range of tricks, both psychological and physical, to ensure his victory. In any game, you will constantly ask how he's planning to win, why he's really doing certain things, and what's really going on. At the end of the matches, the tricks are revealed, and they all work in real life, even if they do require one to be highly skilled or lucky in order to perform them.\r\nThe story centers around the various matches he undertakes and the interactions between the various characters, like Mika Shishidou, the beautiful granddaughter of the school headmaster, who is highly intelligent but contemptuous and superb, or Abidani, the vampiric looking dorm superintendent and main villain (for now) in the series, who has a sadistic personality and whose goal is to make Tomu leave his school (or to get him killed).\r\nAs the story unfolds, more about Tomu's past is revealed, leading to unpredictable turns of events.",

They were assembled by Prof. Saotome and became Earth's first line of defense against the Dinosaur Empire, which is a civilization of reptile-like humanoids, who evolved from the now-extinct dinosaurs that roamed the earth millions of years ago.\r\n\r\nThe series was groundbreaking in the anime mecha genre: for the very first time, it introduced the concept of separate machines combining to form a super robot. Using three jets, Getter Robo could combine in three different ways to create three different versions of Getter Robo for different conditions and situations. This idea was originally discussed during the creation process for Mazinger Z (the first super robot to be piloted internally), but was dropped and then developed for Getter Robo. This combination idea proved to be a very powerful concept that has been used in the super robot genre ever since. ",

Unfortunately, Yamabuki`s true owner, who had been sick, was healthy enough to take her back. She didn`t feel she could handle two dogs, and decided that he would not take Riki in. Riki severely missed his mother, and one day set out to meet her. On his way, he is attacked by a pack of dogs. Hopelessly outnumbered, Riki tries to escape and falls into a river. Waking up, he learns that his father, Shiro, has rescued him. Riki had never seen his father, but had known his name. Shiro, on the other hand, didn`t know that Riki was his son and left before Riki could say anything. But, not before giving him a speech on being strong. Riki makes it his goal and constantly tries to get stronger.\r\n\r\nOne day, a child named Daisuke takes a toy car (one children can ride in) through a roaded mountain pass with an incline. Riki, while traveling to see his mother, notices him racing down. A truck, not seeing Daisuke, hits the boy and sends him flying over the road railing. Afraid that he is dead, the driver moves on. Daisuke, although only bruised, is knocked out. Riki jumps onto a ledge and howls, hopeing someone would hear. Instead, the pack that attacked him heard him and came. After being abused, the pack came to hate humans and attacked Daisuke. Riki, in an effort to save him, fought against the dogs and succeeded in winning. Gohei and Shiro eventually showed up, and the pack ran off. Shiro finally found out that Riki was his son.\r\n\r\nGohei, Shiro, and a few others head out to fight Akakabuto. Seeing this, Riki follows the van. Gohei intends to kill Akakabuto, but the bear is too strong. Gohei shot the bear in the eye, and the bullet became lodged in the beast`s brain. This made him go insane and, while biting Shiro, fall over a cliff. Riki witnessed all this, and was distraught when his father fell.

But his life long dream that no one else, not even his family, knows about is to be a manga author, which realistically speaking has near impossible odds of working out.

    "desc": "Barefoot Gen recounts the bombing of Hiroshima from the perspective of a young boy, Gen, and his family. But the book's themes (the physical and psychological damage ordinary people suffer from war's realities) ring chillingly true today. Gen and his family have long been struggling without much food, money or medicine, but despite hardships, they try to maintain a semblance of normal life. The adults are exhausted and near despair; the children take air raids and starvation more or less in stride. Nakazawa, a Hiroshima survivor, effectively portrays the strain of living in this environment and shows how efforts to stay upbeat in dire circumstances sometimes manifest as manic, irrational humor. The story offers some optimism: characters perform acts of self-sacrifice for the sake of neighbors and loved ones (e.g., when Gen's pregnant mother becomes ill from malnutrition, he and his brother pose as orphans and perform in the streets, throwing the money over the walls of their home so they won't get caught). Underneath this can-do attitude are the parents' deep guilt and sense of helplessness. When the children clamor ecstatically over a scrap of food, the parents dissolve in shame and grief. The art is sharply drawn and expressive, and the narrative has such a natural rhythm, it's easy to get pulled into the family's life, making the cataclysm readers know awaits them all the more real, intimate and difficult to take. Despite its harrowing nature, this work is invaluable for the lessons it offers in history, humanity and compassion.",

After being pursued by people who have turned into monsters due to an elixir her father created, she finds herself under the protection of the Shinsengumi. Her fathers elixir, originally created for the Shinsengumi, will give strength and healing power to anyone who drinks it, but will also cause them to eventually turn into a blood-crazed monster. Will the Shinsengumi be able to protect her and help her find her father, or will they fall prey to the temptation of drinking the elixir? [tethysdust]\r\n\r\nBased on a popular otome game, Hakuouki follows Chizuru and the Shinsengumi in an alternate reality. Chizuru travels to Kyoto in search of her missing father but after being involved in an incident, ended up being taken in by the Shinsengumi where she meets the members including the famous Hijikata Toshizo and Okita Soshi. Chizuru’s father was conducting government research for strengthening the Shinsengumi and developed the ochimizu. The ochimizu is a formula that gives demon like strength and regeneration effects but once taken, the user experiences extreme pain and eventually turns into a blood hungry monster.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to defend Chizuru, Hijikata takes the ochimizu and although the situation was saved, he is now affected with the illness. Okita is also forced to take the formula when his terminal cancer prevents him from defending Chizuru and himself. Feeling responsible for their actions, Chizuru must fight her feeling of helplessness and find the courage to support the Shinsengumi.",

    "desc": "February 23rd, 20XX. \r\nLooking for a job in the famous TV station at Odaiba, college senior Jin Mishima attended the recruitment orientation. Not far away from the station, Nanako Okano, a gothic lolita trying to attend a concert, found out that her friends tricked her about the concert ticket because of jealousy. The two bumped into each other and reunited -- they were junior high classmates -- moments before an earthquake of Richter Scale 8.1 turned the island (the entire city, in fact) into ruins. \r\n\r\nFrom here on, 51 Ways is a predictable but remarkably believable survival adventure. Based on a well-researched novel by Minoru Watanabe, the series paints a picture not quite as explicit and horrifying as ones in other apocalyptic fiction, but one that is frightening in its detail. \r\n\r\nLike many of Furuya s other works, we are also shown just how fragmented and superficial Japanese youth has become: gals, rock stars, Gothic Lolita s, otaku, salarymen, ganguro, and schoolgirls are all here in their self-imposed stereotypical, shallow glory. But while the ugliness of the fragmentation of Tokyo youth is striking - these people all come together in the face of disaster in a way that is ultimately hopeful. When you strip off the posing and expensive clothing: we are all the same.\r\n\r\nIn the end, 51 Ways is one of Furuya s most optimistic and mainstream works. It would make a lovely gateway drug for more timid independant comic readers or shoujo fans looking for something with a bit more bite.\r\n\r\n(Source: ANN & Anime Online)",

She is feeling restless, and she wants to find a guy to fall in love with.

One day, on Christmas Eve, an interesting guy comes in and asks for job at the store. They do, but the hours are really bad (evening shift). That-disappointed-guy then talks to Miyuki and knows she's single. The guy suddenly asks her to go out with him!

By now, any concept of a world in which women exist as ordinary people is long gone. Society has re-structured itself around all-male families, and gay relationships have become the norm.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of Marginal, the Holy Mother is assassinated by a terrorist known as Grinja.

The public, which is superstitious and devout, believes this easily. Only government officials know that behind the scenes, there is a frantic effort to create a new being with an XXY chromosome -- a male capable of giving birth. (This is a BL misrepresentation of an actual phenomenon known as Klinefelter's Syndrome.)\r\n\r\nThe manga's story revolves around one such boy -- Kira, the product of a genetic experiment, who becomes involved in a three-way relationship with Grinja, the aforementioned terrorist, and Ashijin, a young man who calls himself Kira's owner. A complex plot and flawless world-building make the story irresistible, and Kira's search for freedom is as symbolic as it is gripping.\r\n\r\n(Source: The Pink Panzer)",

Despite him being found out, and after some helpful intervening of the perverted student council president, the principal of the school decides that he can stay at the school. The next day, Mei comes to school with Fuuka and apologizes for hiding the fact that he was a witch, and informs the others how he is apparently male.

By using it, a human being can slow down the effects of radiation on his body, but at the same time he begins to control them.

Its utilisation on the territory could mean the end of the fragile peace for the planet.

The story revolves around the eponymous fortress in the St. Gotthard Pass which is ruled by a sadistic tyrant. Basically, each chapter deals with characters who for some reason have to cross the pass and who end up getting interrogated by the mentioned tyrant.\r\n\r\nWhat sets this manga apart is the fact that there's rarely a happy ending for our protagonists. The author pulls no punches to show us just how brutal and inhuman the Middle Ages really were.",

Fortunately, a mysterious girl named Orochi is there to divert the car enough, so that Lisa`s injuries aren`t fatal. As a result though, Orochi falls asleep for several decades.\r\n\r\nEventually, Orochi wakes to find that she is being taken into the mansion where the two sisters now live together as older women where the truth gradually emerges where we find out the true nature of these sisters.",

    "desc": "The series began as a fairly humorous and lighthearted satire of Japan's teenage delinquent-gang subculture told from the perspective of Matsushita Tadashi (who also narrates these early Karate Bu stories), a 2nd year student at Kangokou High and a constant target of Kangokou's numerous bullies who beat him up routinely after school. He is almost always accompanied by his best friend Saitou Takaki, who is also constantly harassed.\r\n\r\nAs the pair grow increasingly tired of being victimized they decide to join the titular Karate Club, which is notorious throughout Osaka's youth gangs for training and producing the city's most hardened and toughest teenage thugs while maintaining the facade of a legit school sports club. But when they join the club, they find themselves picked on just as much if not worse by the club's current members. But as the story progresses they grow to be increasingly capable fighters.\r\n\r\nAlong with the manga's change in attitude and central character, the various teenage fighters throughout the series grew increasingly stronger and even began to tap into superhuman ki abilities, putting Osu!! Karate Bu in the company of other similar epic Sh?nen fighting manga such as Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball, and Fist of the North Star.\r\n\r\nOsu!! Karate Bu was wildly popular in its native Japan, but is otherwise almost completely unknown in most other countries. It spawned a four episode OVA mini-series released over a period of two years from 1990-1992, a 1990 live action movie, and a 1994 Super Famicom fighting game.",

Asano\\\\\\'s latent, surreal sense of humor, which percolated beneath the surface of his more serious works, is released to its full potential, transforming what is--on the surface--a classic bildungsroman in wild and unpredictable ways. Witness the titular Punpun (pronounced \\\\\\\"poon-poon\\\\\\\"), who is depicted as a tiny, caricatured bird in an otherwise normal human setting. The extreme depictions of his overactive imagination are matched at each step by even more bizarre characters.\r\n\r\nAsano keeps a careful balance of exaggeration and realism in both theme and presentation; imagine a stage performance of Looney Tunes. The mood of the manga swings between slapstick and nightmarish but nevers fails to be striking and evocative.",

For some reason Chiyako was determined to be Natsume`s best friend, and naturally there is no way Natsume would refuse Rui`s sister--and the easiest method to get to know Rui.\r\n\r\nNatsume soon learned (mostly from Chiyako) that besides being younger than herself and actually her kouhai, Rui was also a real, professional model, an extremely moody one. He is a spoilt person that often showed a very nasty attitude. To top it all he HATED summer thoroughly and completely. But nothing of these could kill Natsume`s love for Rui. How would Natsume, the simple and plain summer girl win Rui`s heart? A funny, cheerful and romantic",

This marked the start of Aiola s story and the battle of the Gold Saints against the Titans.\r\n\r\nEpisode.G is set 7 years before the events at the beginning of the original Saint Seiya Manga, and 6 years after the death of the Gold Saint Sagittarius Aiolos",

In this version, Yoshitsune was actually a weak, sickly boy who met an exact body replica in Hyouta, a traveling orphan who earn his living on the street. Being physically stronger, Hyouta was led to become a replacement for Yoshitsune, eventually claiming the name as his own.\r\n\r\nThis manga is a fictional story (albeit with many historical references) of his journey to restore the honor of Genji (Minamoto) Clan.\r\n\r\nFrom DragonVoice:\r\nThis is naturally a shounen manga and deals with the orphaned boy Hyouta who's in a group of traveling entertainers and one day he encounters a fine noble woman named Tokiwa who requests the group to perform at her home. But her intentions are not what they seem to be... Read the rest for yourself ^^ The first chapter will probably remind you guys of the story of \"The Prince and the Beggar\".",

However one day after a competition, he stumbled over the pretiest pair of legs he had ever seen! Their owner, a young girl practicing tennis makes a promise with Ide that she will teach him how to play. After seeing the name tag on her racket bag, Ide puts all his efforts into passing the test for accessing the same high school she goes to, Makunogama. In his first days in his new high school, Ide discovers two things: an old friend of his is also attending, and nobody knows of a girl with the name he saw on the tag! He and his friend join the school tennis club, where they meet another first year, Takita Louis (Ruui), a very good tennis player with a little of an attitude problem.\r\n\r\nHowever things start to look better for Ide when his dear missing girl appears in the school! As it happens, he misread her name on the tag. Takada Hinako was well known as one of the members of the tennis club, but some time after meeting Ide for the first time she suffered an accident and has now lost the use of her left leg. Hinako is no longer a happy spirited girl and tells Ide she can`t fullfill her promise.\r\n\r\nEventually the opposite characters of Louis and Ide end up confronting each other in a tennis match. Ide is an incredible fast learner, but he is no match... until Hinako decides to give him advice. Things only get worse, however, when their club president decides to put Louis and Ide as a doubles pair for the upcoming inter-highschool tournament! (Source: M-U)",

Later, a friend of Hai was caught by the new police inspector Shao ZhiSiün. Hai snuck out to save her friend... but got caught also. Meanwhile, she met Michael again. When Hai's father heard that his daughter was being held in custody by the new police inspector, he tried to bribe the new guy, but failed. The new police inspector was not to be bought. So Hai's father bluffed and said he didn't care what would happen to the two (his daughter and the other young pirate). He thought his daughter should be able to get herself out of the mess. Michael helped Hai conceal her true identity so that Shao believed that Hai and her friend are just innocent civilians who were forced to join the pirates and arranged for them to work in his house...\r\n",

Her friend tells her to eat a piece of candy that works like a love potion. All the guys are into her now, even her good friend Shimon! But when she really falls for him, she worries that their love is a lie…\r\n2. Mami (Kie’s BFF) always gets asked out, but consistently turns everyone down. One day she’s approached by a Jack Johnson-loving underclassman who wants her to test out some sweets. Mami doesn’t like sweets, but she ends up falling for him. Unfortunately, he’s already got someone he likes…\r\n3. Tomomi is called in on the day before Christmas Eve to fill in for a volunteer that couldn’t come to school to help bake cakes. The only other volunteer there turns out to be the student council president, who is totally quiet and nerdy. The two end up having fun together, though…\r\n4. Maika is in love with her teacher. She even goes out of her way to be with him– she volunteers after school to pick weeds. She thought it’d be just her and the teacher, but another boy ends up volunteering as well. Maika confesses to her teacher, and he ends up quitting his job. The other volunteer tells Maika that he did it so he could be together with her…\r\n5. Hiro completely transformed himself when he entered high school. He’s so popular he’s called “Mr. Valentine”! When Valentine’s day comes around, the only thing he can think of is the one girl who gave him chocolate back when he was ugly in middle school…\r\n6. Ginjirou has a good friend, Akira, who always steals his thunder. It’s especially humiliating because Akira is actually a girl (but she looks like a gorgeous guy). Whenever a girl’s into Gin and they happen to meet Akira, they always end up falling for the latter. But when a guy asks Akira out, Gin gets a little jealous",

When not at school, Nika is a scary, sloppy, tight-fisted girl who wears glasses, an ugly sweatsuit, and has her hair pulled back into unattactive buns. She lays around playing video games and reading manga (ack, sounds like me…). Her attitude is bossy and cranky, and she travels far out of her way to shop where she won’t be recognized.\r\n\r\nEvery day, Nika “Switches On” with a strict regimen of beautification that involves primping and plucking and careful dressing. When she leaves for school she sparkles and smiles, and no one at school has any idea about her true nature. (Nika’s two sides reminds me of the heroine of KareKano). The only person who knows about Nika’s Switched On/Off modes is her brest friend, who is also aware of the reasons behind the changes.\r\n\r\nHowever, soon a second person finds about about Nika’s personalities - someone who has his own On/Off switch, but in reverse! His name is KAMIYAMA Arata, and he is a recent transfer student. He meets Nika when she is in OFF Mode, and then again at school when she is ON, and quickly makes the connection, much to her horror. However Nika can see that he has his little secret. At school, Arata wears thick swirly-eyed glasses and messy hair that make some bullies think he is an otaku. However, at home, he ditches the glasses and is downright gorgeous! He is just the opposite of Nika, but why?\r\n\r\nNow that they know each other’s secrets, they form a strange relationship. Nika blindly continues her habit, changing modes from school life and home life, while he finds her to be a very amusing person the more he watches her antics.

A chance conversation between the two inspires Haruhi to form the SOS Brigade, a school club created for the sole purpose of getting these supernatural beings together. The initial members consist of the mute bookworm Yuki Nagato, the timid but voluptuous Mikuru Asahina, and the polite and ever-smiling Itsuki Koizumi. By the end of this first volume, Kyon quickly finds out that these seemingly “helpless victims” of Haruhi’s are actually members of secret organizations–both futuristic and alien–keeping watch over Haruhi as she is the pinnacle of some major calamity on the horizon… (Source: Yen Press)",

This all came to an end one day when Eiji, the younger brother of her school tutor and a classmate of hers, told her that she looked \"fugly\" when she smiled. Even though he moved away soon after, she took his insult to heart and it's been two years since anyone's seen her smile. Now that Eiji's back in town though, what will become of her?!",

The boy resided in an orphanage, the same one that Tiger Mask grew up in during his childhood. Feeling that he did not want the boy to idolize a villain, Tiger was inspired to be a heroic wrestler.\r\n\r\nThe main antagonists in the manga and anime was Tiger's Cave, a mysterious organization that trained young people to be villainous heel wrestlers on the condition that they gave half of their earnings to the organization. Tiger Mask was once a member of Tiger's Cave but no longer wanted anything to do with them, instead donating his money to the orphanage. This infuriated the leader of the organization and he sent numerous assassins, including other professional wrestlers, to punish him.\r\n\r\nMost of the environment and characters were fictitious, but real-life pro wrestlers Antonio Inoki and Giant Baba were included in the manga and anime as well.",

He sits directly in front of her, and she spends a lot of her time observing him and writing down her thoughts in a little notebook devoted entirely to him. Ume is fairly comfortable with her situation of loving him from afar (well, from one seat behind). After all, there is no hope for her. Isezaki-kun has a girlfriend who is pretty and nice, and practically perfect. He seems to really like her. So Ume spends her time writing about him instead.\r\n\r\nNaturally, this situation can’t last for long, and sure enough, things change when Isezaki forgets his notebook one day, and asks Ume if he can borrow her notes. Ume, totally dazzled that Isezaki actually SPOKE TO HER, hands him her class notes… only to realize she gave him the wrong notebook! Before she can grab the notebook back, Isezaki-kun is reading the notebook about himself. He quickly realizes what it is, and is understandably surprised. Absolutely mortified, Ume grabs the notebook back and runs from the class. Oh no, now everyone will know, now Isezaki knows, oh, what an embarrassing mess!\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, Isezaki is actually a nice guy, and he handles learning about Ume’s crush rather well. He isn’t mean or anything. He takes it all with good humor, and even decides to be friends with Ume! But this is sort of pleasure and Pain for Ume. On one hand, she gets to actually speak to him sometimes. On the other, it sucks being close to a guy who you really like, knowing he has a girlfriend. But wait, what’s this? Isezaki has broken up with his girlfriend? can it be true? Or did she break up with him? Does he still love her? Could this be Ume-chan’s big chance? Isezaki knows she likes him, can she convince him to like her back?\r\n\r\nIncluded is the oneshot: Nanairo Closet.",

With his superior deductive powers, Shinjurou solves various challenging cases. Meanwhile, Inga, an attractive young lad, serves as Shinjurou's \"buddy\".

Kaishou has used a clear head and the massive amount of information at his fingertips to lead to the solution of a great number of cases. But there's an underside to Kaishou's brilliant deduction work, which is that Shinjurou Yuuki, \"the Last Great Detective\", is the one who actually uncovered \"the truth\" in those cases. However, the public doesn't know this and thus refers to Shinjurou as the \"Defeated Detective\". Still, Shinjurou, together with Inga, can't help but search for the truth.\r\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

While cleaning out the temple storage, Ushio accidentally unseals the chamber Tora was trapped in. Initially, Ushio wisely refuses to remove the spear pinning Tora (??, Japanese for tiger) down, as Tora unwisely makes the strategic blunder of mentioning that the first thing he would do upon being freed would be to devour Ushio; but Tora's unsealed presence attracts various demons to the premises, and Ushio is forced to free Tora in exchange for his help. The series focuses on their relationship, interspersed with battles against mythological foes, and with Tora's attempts to grapple with modern life and gobble up Ushio.\r\n\r\nWon the Seiun Award for Best Comic of the Year in 1997.

He is completely not boyfriend material in her eyes and, even if he was, Chiaki already has a boyfriend. Their mysterious teacher Mr. Yamada sees this relationship between the two students and offers an experiment. He is able to make copies of people and objects and does so with Chiaki, creating a copy of her, except the copy has no knowledge of her boyfriend. Yoshio will hit on the Chiaki copy, who is named Koaki, and he'll try to make her fall in love with him. After a specified amount of time, the copy and original will be combined back together and which ever love is stronger between the current boyfriend and Yoshio will overwrite all other emotions. So this love experiment begins and both Chiaki and Koaki, being the same person, thinks Yoshio has no chance in hell but with each passing day, some feelings begin to bubble. [vyc]",

They have never crossed words before, and even a small interaction between them results in her fan club beating him. Yet when a falling part of the school`s building is about to send him to the afterlife, it was her who came to his rescue. Except, she was dressed as a witch, carrying him in her arms and floating on a broom. She continues to protect him using her fire magic until the attempt on his life ends. She tells him it is her mission to protect him, and that now she can finally protect him openly (she used different means to protect him undercover)\r\n\r\nWhy was Takamiya attacked, who asked Kagari to protect him, why does she refer to him as my princess and what is her fan club going to do to him now that she will be close to him openly?\r\n\r\nWe will need to wait to find out!",

With the exception of having a screwed up cross-dressing devil for a dad, Shinghis life is absolute perfection (*cough* of lies) until one day, Sung-Hae transfers to his school.\r\n\r\nWhile being a complete martial artist freak, she also likes to fib just a little in front of those who know her.... you know, like acting like she is just a scared little girl who d play with kittens rather than break brick walls with her head~! After all, how can anything go wrong when you are as cute as Sung-Hae?\r\n\r\nFate has brought these two masters of lies together and the two must battle it out to see who will be crowned the undefeated heavy-weight champion of fakeness!",
